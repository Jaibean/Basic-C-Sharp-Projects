# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Learning C# with The Tech Academy
## Introduction
I learned how to use the .NET and .NET Core framework with C# through exercises/ projects in Visual Studio. Most of this folder are basic exercies to understand the fundamentals to put together 2 projects.
## Projects
- BlackJack (21)
- Car Insurance
## Twenty One
This project utilizes all basic C# fundamentals to create a Console interactive application. The game is sculpted through classes and loops to create a deck, a dealer, the player, and set of rules. This game follows the principals of the card game 21 and allows the player to even place bets! The deck is shuffled before and gives the player the option to hit or stay each deal. 
## Car Insurance
This project utilizes the MVC web application template to create a car insurance web site that stores information in a database. I learned how to use Entity Framework 6 to set up the shell of the site then added in logic to generate a quote for an interested prospect. This applicatoin has an Admin section as well that allows the admin to see what quotes were generated.
